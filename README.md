# responsive-portfolio

This is a First attempt at creating a website from scratch using some of the tools from bootstrap to help add some very nice looking buttons, images, and styling techniques from all rthe different components that make a website look nice. I like that you can use Bootstrap to create a web page that looks just as professional as another website. there is definitely a lot to learn when it comes to using bootstrap but it is very effective to learn when playing with your own websites and trying to show off your skills. 

## HOME

The about me page is basically showing an image of myself and describing who I am and what I do and what I hope to be doing in the future. I have added an image but I still to figure out the formatting to make the text wrap around the picture so it doesn't waste space looking boring. 

## PORTFOLIO

This is where I will be putting in projects that I worked on and creating links to those projects for people to check out my work and use them at their leisure. I have already added my password generator, which is the homework assignment right after this portfolio. I currently have a bunch of placeholder kittens there just to make it somewhat adorable and see what it looks like when I added these kittens to the portfolio.

## CONTACT

This is where I added an email address and name as well as a message for anyone looking to contact me and tell me what they thought of my website. I will be adding my personal contact in the future I just wasn't sure how to incorporate that into the contact section.
